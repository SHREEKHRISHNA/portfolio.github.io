            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Our latest 3D design project aims to revolutionize the way we interact with urban landscapes. 
                Through innovative design concepts and advanced technology, we are creating a dynamic 
                environment that seamlessly integrates architecture, nature, and functionality.</p><br>
                <p>
                    This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to our design process, detailing the 
                    key components, specifications, and visual representations of the project. From initial 
                    conceptualization to final implementation, we strive to provide insight into our creative 
                    vision and the practical considerations driving our design.

                <h2>Design Components in Fusion 360</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Bodies</h3>
                        <p>Bodies represent the physical geometry of your design. Each body can be a distinct part or feature, such as a main structure, a housing, or a component within a larger assembly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Components</h3>
                        <p>Components are individual parts within your design that can be moved, assembled, and modified independently. They allow you to organize and manage complex assemblies with multiple interconnected parts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Features</h3>
                        <p>Features refer to the specific operations or modifications applied to bodies or components to create or edit their geometry. This includes extrusions, cuts, fillets, chamfers, and other modeling operations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Constraints</h3>
                        <p>Constraints define the relationships between different components or bodies within an assembly. They ensure proper alignment, motion, and interaction between parts, such as mates, joints, and motion links.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Sketches</h3>
                        <p>Sketches serve as the foundation for creating 3D geometry in Fusion 360. They consist of 2D profiles drawn on reference planes or surfaces, which can be used to define the shape and dimensions of features.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Lofts</h3>
                        <p>Lofts are a type of feature that creates a smooth transition between two or more profiles. They are commonly used to create complex shapes, surfaces, or transitions between different sections of a design.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Patterns</h3>
                        <p>Patterns allow you to replicate features or components in a design across specified directions and distances. This includes linear patterns, circular patterns, and component patterns, which can streamline the modeling process for repetitive elements.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Assemblies</h3>
                        <p>Assemblies are collections of components and bodies arranged in a hierarchical structure to represent the physical relationships between parts. They enable you to model complex systems or products composed of multiple interconnected parts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Sculpting Features</h3>
                        <p>Sculpting features provide advanced modeling tools for creating organic shapes, freeform surfaces, and artistic designs. These include sculpting brushes, T-splines, and deformation tools for shaping and refining geometry.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Sheet Metal Features</h3>
                        <p>For designs involving sheet metal fabrication, Fusion 360 offers specialized features for creating and modifying sheet metal components. This includes flanges, bends, hems, and other operations specific to sheet metal design.</p>
                    </li>

<p>1]Sketching: Begin by sketching the profile of the piston and the shape of the crankshaft. <br>

   2] Extruding: Extrude the sketches to create 3D models of the piston and crankshaft. <br>
    
   3] Adding Details: Add features such as piston rings, connecting rod mounts, and fillets to the piston. Design the crankshaft with journals, counterweights, and fillets for strength. <br>
    
   4] Assembly: Create an assembly file and insert the piston and crankshaft components. Use joints to simulate the motion between the two components. <br>
    
   5] Testing and Refinement: Test the motion of the piston and crankshaft assembly. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure smooth operation. <br>
    
   6] Documentation: Finally, create drawings and documentation to communicate the design intent and specifications of the piston and crankshaft assembly. <br></p></div>
